# Overview
`q` is an LLM-powered copilot for the command line, designed to keep programers in the terminal and reduce time spent looking things up. It can generate shell commands, write Python scripts, construct regex patterns, and more, all from the comfort of your command line.

# Installation

You can use `q` as a prebuilt executable or directly as a Python script. The executable is more convenient if your system is supported, while the script is more flexible and can be easily customized.

In either case you will be asked for an OpenAI API key the first time `q` is prompted, which you can create [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

## Prebuilt Executable

Download the appropriate binary for your system from the [Releases page](https://github.com/tk744/q/releases/latest) to a directory in your path (e.g. `~/.local/bin/`) and make it executable:

```
wget -qO ~/.local/bin/q https://github.com/tk744/q/releases/download/v1.2/q-v1.2-linux-x86_64 && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/q
```

Note that these binaries are built on the latest version of each system using GitHub Actions, and therefore may not work on older system versions. If you encounter issues, consider using the script directly.

## Python Script

Requires Python 3.8+. Clone the repository and install the `requirements.txt` file, then run the script directly or copy it to a directory in your path (e.g. `~/.local/bin/`) to run it globally:

```
git clone https://github.com/tk744/q.git
cd q && pip install -r requirements.txt
cp q ~/.local/bin/q
```

# Usage

The basic syntax is `q [command] TEXT [options]`. `q` accepts at most one command and any number of options. Any arguments between the command and options is treated as the input text.

`q` stores the output of generation commands to the clipboard so you can paste it wherever you need it. This only works on non-headless environments (no VMs and Docker containers); check [here](https://pyperclip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#not-implemented-error) if it doesn't work.

For a full list of commands and options, run `q -h`.

## Commands

Each command runs a tailored LLM prompt using the OpenAI API and returns the response.

### Generate Code

Use the `-c` or `--code` command to generate code snippets:

```
$ q -c copy user input to clipboard
import pyperclip

user_input = input("Enter text to copy to clipboard: ")
pyperclip.copy(user_input)
```

By default this generates Python code, but you can specify a different programming language in the prompt itself (or [modify the default value](#modifying-default-values)):

```
$ q -c copy user input to clipboard in rust
use std::io::{self, Write};
use clipboard::{ClipboardContext, ClipboardProvider};

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    print!("Enter text to copy to clipboard: ");
    io::stdout().flush().unwrap();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();

    let mut ctx: ClipboardContext = ClipboardProvider::new().unwrap();
    ctx.set_contents(input.trim().to_string()).unwrap();
}
```

You can redirect the output to a file and run it instantly:

```
$ q -c fib function w main function > fib.py && python3 fib.py
Enter a number: 10
Fibonacci number at position 10 is 55
```

### Generate Shell Commands

Use the `-s` or `--shell` command to generate shell commands:

```
$ q -s add README.md to prev commit and push changes
git add README.md && git commit --amend --no-edit && git push --force
```

By default this generates Bash commands for a Linux system, but you can specify a different shell or OS in the prompt itself (or [modify the default value](#modifying-default-values)):

```
$ q -s auto hide the dock on macos
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool true; killall Dock
```

You can pipe the output to the shell interpreter to run it instantly:

```
$ q -s count line numbers in fib.py | bash
12 fib.py
```

### Generate Regex Patterns

Use the `-x` or `--regex` command to generate regex patterns:

```
$ q -x html tags
<[^>]+>
```

### Generate Images

Use the `-i` or `--image` command to generate 1024x1024 images (note: this is very expensive):

```
$ q -i george washington riding a harley through the american civil war
Image saved to q_george_washington_riding_a_harley_through_the_american_civil_war.png.
```

### Search the Web

Use the `-w` or `--web` command to search the web for up-to-date information (note: this is slightly more expensive):

```
$ q -w steph curry age
Stephen Curry is 37 years old.
```

### Rephrase Text

Use the `-r` or `--rephrase` command to rephrase text for enhanced fluency:

```
$ q -r watchin haters wonder why gambino got the game locked
Watching critics wonder why Gambino dominates the game.
```

### General Prompting

Use the `-p` or `--prompt` command to prompt a regular language model about anything:

```
$ q -p give me a punchline without the setup
"â€¦and that's why you never trust a penguin with your ice cream!"
```

## Multi-Turn Commands

Use `q` without specifying a command to build on previous responses and run contextualized multi-turn commands:

```
$ q -w nba champions
The Oklahoma City Thunder won the 2025 NBA Finals, defeating the Indiana Pacers 4-3. (nba.com)
$ q champion odds
As of July 4, 2025, the Oklahoma City Thunder are favored to win the 2025-26 NBA Championship, with odds of +210. Other top contenders include the Cleveland Cavaliers at +750, New York Knicks at +1600, and Houston Rockets at +850. (findbet.com, espn.com)
```

This enables many useful follow-up interactions, such as interactively refining generated code:

```
$ q -s get cuda version
nvcc --version
$ nvcc --version
bash: nvcc: command not found
$ q command not found
cat /usr/local/cuda/version.txt
$ cat /usr/local/cuda/version.txt
cat: /usr/local/cuda/version.txt: No such file or directory
$ q file not found
nvidia-smi | grep "CUDA Version"
$ nvidia-smi | grep "CUDA Version"
| NVIDIA-SMI 560.35.02    Driver Version: 560.94    CUDA Version: 12.6 |
```

You can even refine generated images:

```
$ q -i low poly rubber duck
Image saved to q_low_poly_rubber_duck.png.
$ q make it float in a high res bathtub
Image saved to q_make_it_float_in_a_high_res_bathtub.png.
```

Or ask questions about the previous response:

```
$ q -c function to merge two dictionaries x and y
def merge_dictionaries(x, y):
    return {**x, **y}
$ q what is the time complexity
The time complexity of merging two dictionaries using `{**x, **y}` is O(n + m), where n is the number of elements in dictionary `x` and m is the number of elements in dictionary `y`.
```

## Options

Options are boolean flags that modify the behavior of `q`:

- Use the `-o` or `--overwrite` option to overwrite the previous command.
- Use the `-l` or `--longer` option to increase the max token length of responses (*note: this may increase the cost of API calls*).
- Use the `-n` or `--no-clip` option to disable automatically storing responses to the clipboard.
- Use the `-v` or `--verbose` option to print the model parameters and message history.

You can combine multiple options using their abbreviated forms following a single hyphen:

```
$ q -p knock knock
Who's there?
$ q apple
Apple who?
$ q orange -vo

MODEL PARAMETERS:
model: gpt-4o
max_tokens: 256
temperature: 0.25
frequency_penalty: 0
presence_penalty: 0
top_p: 1

MESSAGES:
System: You are a helpful and knowledgeable AI assistant.
User: knock knock
Assistant: Who's there?
User: orange
Assistant: Orange who?
```

# Customization

`q` was designed to be easily customizable to suit any programmer's needs.

## Modifying Default Values

The following constants can be modified in the script to change the default behavior of `q`:
- `MINI_LLM`: the default model for fast and cheap responses.
- `FULL_LLM`: the default model for long and detailed responses.
- `DEFAULT_MODEL_ARGS`: the default model arguments used by all commands if not overrided.
- `DEFAULT_CODE`: the default language for code generation used by the `-c` command.
- `DEFAULT_SHELL`: the default system for shell command generation used by the `-s` command.
- `LONG_TOKEN_LIMIT`: the max token length for long responses used by the `-l` option.

## Adding New Commands

Add a new command to `q` by inserting a new dictionary in the `COMMANDS` list with the following keys:
- `flags` *(required)*: a list of flags to invoke the command.
- `description` *(required)*: a brief description of the command shown in the help message.
- `messages` *(required)*: the instructions sent to the LLM, using `{text}` as a placeholder for the input text.
- `model_args` *(optional)*: override default model arguments set in `DEFAULT_MODEL_ARGS` or set new arguments.
- `clip_output` *(optional)*: set to `True` to copy the output to the clipboard; `False` by default.

Refer to the existing commands in the script for examples.
